1 About sharemyshelf

  sharemyshelf is a website for managing your book collection with your friends
  and family. sharemyshelf allows you to keep three lists: a list of the books 
  that you own, a list of the books that you have currenty loaned out to 
  someone, and list of books that you would like to have. You can move books 
  between the three lists freely, add new books via a search functionality or 
  remove books. 
  The website further allows you to find any friends who have signed up and 
  make your lists searchable to each other. You can view your friends' lists
  directly, which might be useful if you want to borrow a book that a specific 
  friend owns or if you want to view a wishlist for a friend's upcoming 
  birthday.
  You can also search through all of your friends' books at once, if you are 
  looking to borrow a particular book. Sending email requests to borrow can be 
  done with the click of a button.
  Are you more the visual type? Here is the link to a quick video overview:

2 Installation (while it is not yet a real website)

    2.1 Download 
        
        (same as CS50 PSet7 with exception of one subdirectory "bookcovers")
        Open Terminal and navigate to vhosts directory.
          cd ~/vhosts
        Download the project.zip file.
        Unzip the project.zip file.
          unzip project.zip
        Check to see that project directory was created with "ls".
        Remove zip file.
          rm -f project.zip
        Go into project directory.
          cd project
    
    2.2 Permissions
    
        Ensure a few directories are world-executable by executing:
          chmod a+x ~
          chmod a+x ~/vhosts
          chmod a+x ~/vhosts/project
          chmod a+x ~/vhosts/project/public
        Navigate to ~/vhosts/project/public
          cd ~/vhosts/project/public
        Ensure that subdirectories and folders are world-executable:
          chmod a+x css fonts img js
          chmod a+r css/* fonts/* img/* js/*
          cd ~/vhosts/project/public/img
          chmod a+x bookcovers
          chmod a+r bookcovers/*
    
    2.3 Hosts file
    
        In terminal window, open hosts file with admin permissions 
          sudo gedit /etc/hosts
        Carefully add this line at the bottom of that file, which will 
        associate project with the appliance’s "loopback" address (which 
        won’t ever change):
          127.0.0.1 pset7
        Save file and quit gedit.
        If you encounter a Gtk-WARNING with gedit, try restarting the 
        appliance, as via Menu > Log Out > Restart (or via VMware’s own 
        Restart option), then try again.
        
    2.4 Viewing website in browser
    
        Go to http://project/ to open the website.
    
3 A tour of sharemyshelf's functionalities
    
    3.1 Managing user account
    
        3.1.1 Viewing my book lists
        
              By default (or when clicking on the logo), the website displays 
              all three lists: list of owned books, list of books on loan, and
              wishlist. For a new user this shows that all lists are currently
              empty and encourages the user to add books.
              On the left-hand side is a dashboard that allows the user to 
              display one list at a time. This is useful for users who already
              have a lot of books in their shelves or just want to manage a 
              particular list. 
              
        3.1.2 Searching through my book lists
        
              Upon clicking "Search My Shelves" in the nav bar, a user is 
              presented with a search functionality. Here the user can search 
              among his/her own books. This is useful for powerusers who may 
              have a very large book collection where even viewing a particular
              list (3.1.1) may not provide enough granularity. Search terms are
              soted by relevance and they are inclusive. If a certain author is
              searched but a title by another author, both books will be 
              included in the results.
        
        3.1.3 Managing my book lists
        
              Whether in a particular list or through the search functionality,
              users have the ability to click buttons that perform certain 
              actions depending on the current status of a book. 
              Books on "My Bookshelf" can be loaned out, moved to "My Wishlist"
              (if an old copy is worn out or a book was lost), or even removed.
              Books on the list "My Books on Loan" can be moved back to the 
              bookshelf after they are returned to the user. Currently, it is
              up to the user to write in the name of the borrower when lending
              a book. This allows the user to lend books to people who are not 
              registered users.
              Books on "My Wishlist" can be moved to the list of owned books
              when the user obtains a copy of the book or they can be removed 
              of a user no longer wants to have the book on his/her wishlist
        
        3.1.4 Adding new books to my lists
        
              A user can add a new book by using the "Add Books To Shelf" nav 
              link. This renders a form that obtains results from the Google 
              Books API and displays them to the user.
              The user can then select a book from the search results and add 
              it to My Booklist or My Wishlist.
        
    3.2 Interacting with other users
    
        3.2.1 Viewing my list of friends and responding to friend requests
              
              When a user clicks the "My Friends" nav link, he/she can see a 
              list of friends who they have accepted or who accepted them. The 
              user then click on a link to display the friend's lists.
              On the same page, there is a list of friend requests. The user
              has the option to Accept or Reject another user's friend request.
              If he/she accepts the request, the new friend is visible in the 
              friend list and both users can view each other's lists as well as
              search through each other's books. If the request is rejected, 
              the users will be prevented from adding each other in the future.
              
        3.2.2 Viewing my friends' book lists
        
              While on the "My Friends" page, a user can view the individual 
              lists of each of their friends. As with their own lists they can
              see all three at once or each list individually. It's a great way
              to find the right book for your friend's upcoming birthday! There
              is even a link that will bring you to the Amazon page of the book
              you want to buy for a friend.
        
        3.2.3 Searching through my friends' book lists
        
              If a user clicks on the "Search My Friends' Shelves" nav link, 
              he/she can search through all of their friends' books if they 
              currently have them on their bookshelf or have loaned them out.
              The search function works similarly to the search function for 
              the user's own books. Results are matched by substrings and 
              ranked by relevance. If a certain author is searched but a 
              title by another author, both books will be included in the
              results. If more than one friend owns a book, the book will be 
              displayed multiple times. The user has the option to send 
              requests to borrow books directly from the search results per 
              email to his/her friends.
        
        3.2.4 Adding new friends
        
              When a new friend joins the website, the user can search for
              him/her by email or username upon clicking the "Add Friends" nav
              link. The search uses substring matching to find the friend. When
              in doubt, use fewer characters to get more results!

5 Future Functionalities?
  I would like to:
  - make friend requests more robust and allow users to change their mind after
    having rejected someone initially
  - provide a more interactive UI with JQery/JavaScript features to make lists
    sortable
  - allow users to create more elaborate profiles that can have pictures, 
    quotations, tastes in books
  - allow users to tag their books to categories
  - privacy settings that allow users to hide certain books from friends
  - put the website online and let my friends use it :)
